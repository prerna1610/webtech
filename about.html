            <p>I made this website for a competition I took part in which is organized by Amity University Patna. In
                this competition students have to design a webpage based on
                the theme given on the theme BYGONE CULTURES OF BIHAR. So what I did was I collected information from
                the internet and made this website out of it. This website is more like an information website where we
                see the history and culture of Bihar.
