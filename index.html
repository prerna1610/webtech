            The Ancient History of Bihar extends to the very dawn of human civilization and also associated with the
            advent of the earliest myths and legends of Sanatana Dharma. It was the center of a powerful kingdom,
            learning as a cultural center for thousands of years under the patronage of able kingdoms. The word 'Bihar'
            has originated from the 'Viharas' which means resting house of Buddhist monk but it was the Muslim rulers of
            12th Century who started calling the state as 'Bihar'.

            Bihar and its cultural significance are as old as civilization itself. Bihar was once a hub of the richest
            and the most diverse ethnicity. The epics Ramayana and Mahabharata, and Buddhism, all have had a crucial
            role in building the rich culture of Bihar. Some great mythological characters are in deep association with
            the state.
